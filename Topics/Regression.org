#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none appear)
- How can we make predictions about real-world quantities, like sales or life
  expectancy?
- Most often in real world applications we need to understand how one variable
  is determined by *a number of others*

#+REVEAL: split

For example:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none appear)
- How does sales volume change with changes in price. How is this affected by
  changes in the weather?
- How is the interest rate charged on a loan affected by credit history and by
  loan amount?
  
#+REVEAL: split

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none appear)
- We already used correlation coefficient to look at the relationship between 
  /two/ variables, but ...
- We cannot say that the correlation coefficient is a "pure" effect of
  one variable's change on another variable

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - e.g., What if \( x_{1} \) (e.g., price) and \( x_{2} \) (e.g., advertising) are also correlated?

    | \( \rho \)  | Sales | Price | Advertising |
    | Sales       |     1 |  -0.8 |         0.8 |
    | Price       |       |     1 |        -0.9 |
    | Advertising |       |       |           1 |
**** Regression Analysis
:LOGBOOK:
- Note taken on [2018-02-19 Mon 14:58] \\
  A student ask about what is regression conceptually .. should talk about it
  a little bit.
:END:
- Let's you

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Discover relationship between a dependent variable (\( y \)) and 
    multiple independent variables (\( x \)'s) jointly
  - Identify and measure each independent variable (\( x \))'s impact on 
    \( y \) separately 
    - While /controlling for/ (holding others constant) other variables

**** Relationship between \( x \) and \( y \)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Essentially, we want to figure out the relationship between \( y \)
  (dependent variable) and \( x \) (independent, explanatory) variables:

  \[ y_i = f(x_{1i}, x_{2i}, \cdots) \]

  - Where
    
    - \( i \): \( i \)'th observation, \( n \): total number of observations
    - \( y_i \): dependent variable
    - \( x_{ki} \): \( i \)'th observation of \( k \)'th independent
      (explanatory) variable
    - \( f(\cdot) \): the function specifying the relationship between \( y \)
      and \( x \)

#+REVEAL: split

- e.g.,

  \[ \underbrace{y_{i}}_{\text{Sales}_i} = f(\underbrace{x_{
  1i}}_{\text{Price}_i}, \underbrace{x_{2i}}_{\text{Promotion}_i}) \]

- We basically want to know what \( f() \) is. For example,

  \[ y_{i} = f(x_{1i}, x_{2i}) = 1 + 2 \times x_{1i}  + 3 \times x_{2i} \]
**** Functional Form of \( f \): Linear Regression
- In linear regression, we assume the dependent variable (\( y_{i} \)) to be a
  linear function of independent (or explanatory) variables (\( x_{k} \)'s),
  coefficients (\( \beta_{k} \)'s) and the error term (\( \varepsilon_{i} \)):

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  \[  y_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + \varepsilon_{i} \]

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Where

  - \( \beta_k \): coefficient for independent variable \( x_k \), which
    represents the importance of \( x_{k} \) in \( y \)
  - \( \varepsilon_{i} \): the remaining part (error)

    - Unpredictable with \( x \)'s
        - e.g., random-walk of stock prices

#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [frametitle={}]
#+BEGIN_mdframed
Note that \( \beta_0 \) is by itself since it corresponds to the constant term. That is, it 
represents the intercept, and you can think of it as \( x_{0i} \) being 1 everywhere 
(\( \beta_0 \times 1 = \beta_0 \)).

:CUSTOM_ID: Lecture/Regression Analysis: Estimation
:END:
**** Estimation: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Again the regression model is:

  \[  y_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \varepsilon_{i} \]

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- You can rearange terms
  and characterize the error by:

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  \[  \varepsilon_{i} =  y_{i} -  \beta_0 - \beta_{1} x_{1i} \]

- Since \( y_i \) and \( x_{1i} \) are data so they do not vary. Then, as you
  change \( \beta_0 \) and \( \beta_1 \), \( \varepsilon_{i} \) will change.

#+REVEAL: split

Estimation Objective: *minimize* the sum of squared errors across all
observations:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
\[ \sum_{i=1}^n\varepsilon^2_i = \varepsilon^2_1 + \varepsilon^2_2 + \cdots +
   \varepsilon^2_{n-1} + \varepsilon^2_{n} \]
   
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- We want to find values of \( \beta_0 \) and \( \beta_1 \) that minimize the
  sum of squared errors

#+REVEAL: split

Fortunately, we have analytical solutions for the \( \beta_0 \) and \( \beta_1
\):

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
\[ \widehat{\beta_1} = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{n}
   (x_{1i}-\bar{x}_1)(y_{i}-\bar{y}) }{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{1i}-\bar{x})^2 }
   \]

{{{RVL_VSPACE}}}

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
\[ \widehat{\beta_0}  = \bar{y} - \widehat\beta\,\bar{x}_{1} \]

- Where \( \widehat{\beta}_{k} \): estimate (actual number) of coeffcient \(
  \beta_k \)

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Remember how we estimate coefficients (\( \beta_k \)'s)?
- \( \beta_k \) which minimize the sum of squared errors are the
  estimates, \( \widehat\beta_k \)
- How do we measure how well our model performs?

**** Sum of Squares
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none appear)
- Total sum of squares (\( SS_{total} \)) :: @@latex:\quad@@

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  \[  SS_{tot} = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2 \]

  #+LATEX: \iffalse
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

      SS_{err} &= \varepsilon^2_1 + \varepsilon^2_2 + \cdots +
                   \varepsilon^2_{n-1} + \varepsilon^2_{n} = \sum_{i=1}^n \varepsilon^2_i 
   \end{aligned} \]

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  \[ = \sum_{i=1}^n \left\{ y_i - \underbrace{(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i})}_{\text{predicted}} \right\}^2 \]
  #+LATEX: \fi

  #+REVEAL_HTML: <span hidden>
  \[ \begin{aligned}
      SS_{err} &= \varepsilon^2_1 + \varepsilon^2_2 + \cdots +
                   \varepsilon^2_{n-1} + \varepsilon^2_{n} = \sum_{i=1}^n \varepsilon^2_i 
      = \sum_{i=1}^n \left\{ y_i - \underbrace{(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i})}_{\text{predicted}} \right\}^2
   \end{aligned} \]
  #+REVEAL_HTML: </span>
**** Sum of Squared Errors (Residuals)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- \( SS_{error} \) is a measure of how wrong the regression estimates will be
  overall
- \( SS_{error} \) is a measure of variance
- \( y_i \) is sometimes higher, sometimes lower than the regression line
- Actual value of \( y_i \) varies because unobserved factors and randomness
- The regression can never be a perfect predictor
**** How well does regression fit?
- We can use these to construct a value which represents:

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - what % of total variance do we explain with our model?

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    \[ \Rightarrow \dfrac{\text{explained variance}}
       {\text{total variance } (SS_{total})}
    \]

    #+REVEAL: split

  - which can also be represented as

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    \[
       1 - \dfrac{\text{unexplained variance } (SS_{error})}
       {\text{total variance } (SS_{total})}
    \]

***** \( R^2 \)

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- \( R^2 \) :: the percentage of variance in the dependent variable (\( y \))
               explained by the independent variables (\( x \)'s):

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  \[ R^2 = 1 - \dfrac{SS_{error}}{SS_{total}} \]
   
#+REVEAL: split

- \( R^2 \) is between 0 and 1 (0% to 100%)

  {{{FRAG_BLUE(dependent variable (\( y \)))}}} is expected to change when the
  {{{FRAG_BLUE(independent variable (\( x_{1} \)))}}} increases by
  {{{FRAG_BLUE(one)}}} unit
  
#+REVEAL: split

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Suppose we have \( x_{1} \)'s value as 50, and \( \hat\beta_0 = 1 \) and \(
  \hat\beta_1 = 3 \). Then, the predicted \( y \) value is:

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  \[ \underbrace{\hat\beta_0}_{1} + \underbrace{\hat\beta_1}_{3} \times 50 = 151 \]

- If we increase \( x_{1} \) by 1:

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  \[ \underbrace{\hat\beta_0}_{1} + \underbrace{\hat\beta_1}_{3} \times (50 + 1) = 154 \]

- That is, \( y \) increases by \( \hat\beta_1 \) when we increase
'eee' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
#+REVEAL: split

- Mathematically,

  \[  \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial x} = \dfrac{\partial ( \beta_0 + \beta_1 x)}{\partial x} = \beta_1 \]

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- We do hypothesis testing for a mean for /each/ coefficient separately
**** Null and Alternative Hypotheses
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- The null hypothesis is that there is /no/ effect:
  - \( H_{0}: \beta_{k}=0 \qquad H_{A}: \beta_k \ne 0 \) 
    
#+REVEAL: split

- Null hypothesis:
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - \( H_0 \): Winning Percentage of a head coach does not affect his
    compensation 
  - \( H_0 \): \( \beta_{WinPercentage} = 0 \)

- Alternative hypothesis: 
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - College head coaches' winning percentages affects their compensation levels
  - \( H_{a} \): \( \beta_{WinPercentage} \ne 0 \)

**** Regression Results
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- =t Stat=: \( \dfrac{\hat{\beta}_{k}}{SE_{k}} \) (because \( H_0: \beta_k=0
  \)): Reject the null if \( T > |1.96| \)

#+REVEAL: split

- =P-value=: the probability of observing \( \hat{\beta}_{k} \) if the null
  hypothesis is true: reject the null if =P-value= \( < 0.05 (=\alpha) \)

#+REVEAL: split

- 95% \( ((1-\alpha) \times 100 \%) \) Confidence interval: will not include

**** Multiple Regression
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none appear)
- Sales vs. Promotion Discount is an example of simple linear regression
- But sales of a brand depend upon many things
  - TV Ads, In-store promotions, Coupons etc ...

- When many things vary at the same time, it is hard to visually see the
  impact of each factor
- Multiple regression lets you look at an isolated effect of one variable 
  
#+REVEAL: split

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
\[ y_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i, 1} + \cdots + \beta_k x_{i, k} + \cdots +
\beta_K x_{i, K} + \varepsilon_{i} \]

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Interpretation of \( \hat{\beta}_k \): _holding other variables constant_, the
  change in \( y \) if you increase \( x_k \) by 1 unit
  
- Just like the simple regression, mathematically,

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  \[ \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial x_k} = \dfrac{\partial ( \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \beta_k
  x_k + \cdots + \beta_K x_K) }{\partial x_k } = \beta_k. \]

**** \( R^2 \) and Adjusted \( R^2 \)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Recall

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  \[
     R^2 = 1 - \dfrac{\text{unexplained variance } (SS_{error})}
           {\text{total variance } (SS_{total})} = 1 - \dfrac{SS_{error}}{SS_{total}}
  \]

- \( R^2 \) is between 0 and 1 (0% to 100%)
***** \( R^2 \) in multiple regression
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- \( R^2 \) *always* becomes larger when we add more
  independent variables
- So we CANNOT use \( R^2 \) to compare the fit of two different regressions
  with different numbers of independent variables
***** Adjusted \( R^{2} \)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- We use *adjusted* \( R^2 \) to compare regressions with
  different numbers of independent variables

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  \[  R^2_{adj} = 1 - \left\{ \dfrac{SS_{error}}{SS_{total}} \times
      \dfrac{n-1}{n-K-1} \right\} \]

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - \( n \): number of observations
   - \( K \): number of independent (\( x \)) variables included in the model
     
#+REVEAL: split

#+LATEX: \iffalse
\[  R^2_{adj} = 1 - \left\{ \dfrac{SS_{error}}{SS_{total}} \times
    \dfrac{n-1}{n-K-1} \right\} \]
#+LATEX: \fi

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Basically, you give a little bit of penalty for higher \( K \)
- A variable needs to reduce \( SS_{error} \) significantly to overcome the
  penalty

*** Making Predictions in Regression Models
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Lecture/Making Predictions in Regression Models
:END:

Once you have regression results (estimated coefficients,
\( \widehat\beta_k \)'s), it is easy to make predictions given values of
\( x_k \)'s.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Remember we are using the linear model:

  \[ y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \cdots + \varepsilon_i \] 

- For example, estimation results can be:

  \[ y_i = \underbrace{10}_{\widehat\beta_0} +
           \underbrace{3}_{\widehat\beta_1} x_{i1} + \underbrace{3}_{\widehat\beta_2} 
  x_{i2} \]

#+REVEAL: split

- Once we have \( \widehat\beta_k \)'s, given \( x_k \) values, we can
  calculate the *predicted* value of \( y \), \( \widehat y \) by plugging in
  those estimates:

  \[ \widehat{y}_i = \widehat\beta_0 + \widehat\beta_1 x_{i1} + \widehat\beta_2
     x_{i2} + \cdots + 0 \]

  (Because \( \hat{\varepsilon}_i=E[\varepsilon_i]=0 \))

#+REVEAL: split

- For example, if your estimation results are:
  
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  \[ y_i = 10 + 3 x_{i1} + 3 x_{i2} \]

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- The estimate of \( y \) for values of \( x_{1} = 5, x_{2} = 4 \) is:
  
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)  
  \[ \widehat{y} = 10 + 3 \times \underbrace{5}_{x_{1}} + 3 \times \underbrace{4}_{x_{2}} = 37 \]

*** Categorical Variables

**** Use of Dummy Variables
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- To capture the effect of categorical variables
  - Brands, In-store displays, Gender

- Dummy variable has a value of 0 or 1
  - 1 indicates presence of characteristic
  - 0 indicates absence of characteristic

- Sales Estimate = 5.75 + 2.5 \times (if store type is A).
- Note that this gives a {{{FRAG_RED(relative)}}} measure.
- Store type A sales are estimated to be 2.5 units {{{FRAG_RED(more than)}}} store type B.
**** Coding Dummy Variables 
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none appear)
- If a category can either be present or absent, then code:
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Presence as 1 
  - Absence as 0
  - Example: Presence of "In Store Display"
- If a category can be of two types:
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Code one of the category as 1
  - Code the other as 0
  - Example: Male/ Female; Cash/ Credit
**** Coding Dummy Variables: An Example
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Do male teachers get more wage in general?
- Are Texas drivers more likely to buy a pickup truck compared to drivers in
  other states?
***** Model:
- Let \( D_i \) be the dummy variable. Then, when it is true (\( D_{i} =1 \)), the model is:
      
  \begin{align*} 
       y_i  & = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 D_i \\
            & = \underbrace{(\beta_0 + \beta_2)}_{\text{intercept}} + \beta_1 x_{1i} 
  \end{align*}

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- When it is not true (\( D_i = 0 \)), the model is:

  \begin{align*} 
      y_i & = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 D_i \\
          & = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i}
  \end{align*}

#+REVEAL: split

- So \( \beta_2 \) represents the relative difference between the two groups
  in terms of their intercepts

- What does it mean when \( \beta_2 \) is not significant?

**** Dummy Coding for Multi-Category
what if we have more than one category?

e.g., color = {{{{FRAG_RED(red)}}}, {{{FRAG_GREEN(green)}}},
{{{FRAG_BLUE(blue)}}}} is independent variable (\( x \)) and preference is
dependent variable (\( y \))

#+REVEAL: split

use a separate dummy variable for each category, except one (e.g., the last)

- Why do we use \( L-1 \) variables instead of \( L \) in dummy coding?

- If you do, you will get *perfect multicollinearity*

- What is multicollinearity?

**** Multicollinearity

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Source: Two or more independent (\( x_k \)) variables in a multiple
  regression model are highly correlated

- Since two \( x_k \)'s are moving together, it is hard to identify
  which one is causing the changes in \( y \)

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Campus couple example
#+END_NOTES

**** Consequences of Multicollinearity
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none appear)
- Estimates of the effect (coefficients) are less precise
- Small =t-stat= (= large =p-value=)
- =Type 2 Error=: you do not reject the null (\( H_0: \beta=0 \)) when you
  should
- But does *not* actually bias results
**** Fixes
- This is a data problem. If you have sufficient number of observations, high
  correlation between explanatory (predictor) variables is okay

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Standard Errors for estimates become smaller as you increase number of
    sample
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- If you observe it many times, since they are not perfectly
  correlated, there will be cases where the two \( x \)\  \)s move
  differently and \( y \) changes. From that you can identify which
  one is important
#+END_NOTES
**** Perfect multicollinearity
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none appear)
- You have complete dependency among variables (predict one with others)
- Inversion in OLS estimate formula does not work and you cannot estimate the
  model
- Just like \( 1/0 \) does not work
- Not a big problem - you will see the error right away
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Here, let's have an example of this.
#+END_NOTES
***** Dummy Variable Trap
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none appear)
- If you have \( L \) dummies for \( L \) number of categories, including
  a constant term in the regression together guarantee perfect
  multicollinearity

- Analogous to this is that when you know the mean first \( n-1 \) observations then
  you can infer \( n \)'th observation

#+BEGIN_mdframed
Remember the interpretation of \( \beta \), the
coefficient of in linear regression is:

\[ 
   \dfrac{d Q}{d P} = \dfrac{d (\beta_0 + \beta_1 P +
   \varepsilon) }{d P} = \beta_1
\]

That is, the increase in \( Q \)  when \( P \)  increases by 1 unit

When you have a log-log model:

\[ \ln(Q) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ln (P) + \varepsilon\]

\[ \Rightarrow Q = \exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \ln (P) + \varepsilon ) \]

\[ \dfrac{d Q}{d P}  \quad = \underbrace{\exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \ln(P) +
          \varepsilon )}_{Q}
         \cdot \underbrace{\beta_1 \cdot \dfrac{1}{P}}_{\text{Chain Rule}} \\
           \quad =  Q \cdot \beta_1 \cdot \dfrac{1}{P} 
\]

#+LATEX: \iffalse
\[    \dfrac{d Q}{d P}  = Q \cdot \beta_1 \cdot \dfrac{1}{P} \]

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none appear)
  - \( \beta_{own} \): own price elasticity 
  - \( \beta_{cross} \): cross price elasticity
  - \( \beta_{ad} \): advertising elasticity
  - \( \beta_{display} \): impact of display on sales

#+REVEAL_HTML: <span hidden>
#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [frametitle={Interpretation of \( \beta_{display} \)}]
#+BEGIN_mdframed
The Display dummy equals to 1 when the product is on display. Hence, \(
\beta_{display} \) represents the increase in \( \ln(\text{Sales}) \) when the
product is on display comparing to the baseline case where the product is not
on display.  That is,

\[ \beta_{display} = \ln(\text{Sales}_{Display}) - \ln(\text{Sales}_{NoDisplay}) \]
\[ \Rightarrow \beta_{display} = \ln\left(\dfrac{\text{Sales}_{Display}}{\text{Sales}_{NoDisplay}}\right) \]
\[ \Rightarrow \exp(\beta_{display}) = \dfrac{\text{Sales}_{Display}}{\text{Sales}_{NoDisplay}} \]

Hence, \( \exp(\beta_{display}) \) is the ratio between the two sales. For
example, if \( \beta_{display} \) were 0.3, \( \exp(0.3) = 1.35 \), which
means a product's sales increase by 35% when it is on display compared to when
it is not.

 \[ y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{i1} + \cdots + \beta_{K}x_{iK} + \varepsilon_{i} \]

- The error term (\( \varepsilon_{i} \)) is supposed to have mean zero
- Not /predictable/
- However, once they are realized, one can often find some pattern in them,
  which will disappear as more data accumulate
  - e.g., stock prices are supposed to be random-walk; however, from historical data, 
    patterns will pop up

"They ... overfit the data. They had fifty million search terms, and they
found some that happened to fit the frequency of the 'flu' over the
preceding decade or so, but really they were getting idiosyncratic terms
that were peaking in the winter at the time the 'flu' peaks ... but wasn't
driven by the fact that people were actually sick with the 'flu',"

(David Lazer, an interview with [[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6176/1270.2.full][Science]])
*** Takeaways
- Be careful of "overfitting", especially when you have a lot of variables
- Conduct out-of-sample validation
*** Out-of-Sample Validation

- Use only a subset of data (e.g., 80% of the sample; train dataset) to estimate coefficients
- Then predict \( \hat{y}_i \) values for the rest of the sample (validation
  dataset) using the estimated coefficients and actual data for \( x_{k} \)'s
  as if we do not know actual \( y_{i} \):

   \[ \hat{y}_{i}= \hat{\beta}_{0} + \hat{\beta}_{1} x_{1i} +
      \hat{\beta}_{2} x_{2i} + \cdots + \hat{\beta}_{K} x_{Ki} \]

-  Compare $\hat{y}_{i}$ and the actual $y_{i}$
