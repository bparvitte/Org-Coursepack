*Note for Mac users*

- It is required that you have *Excel 2016 for Mac* installed in your device
  for this course, as =Data Analysis ToolPak= and =Solver= add-ins are not
  available in previous versions of Microsoft Excel for Mac. It still has some
  limitations comparing to the Windows version, but you will be able to
  accomplish most of tasks.

*** Activating =Analysis ToolPak= and =Solver= in Excel
- You have to activate the =Analysis ToolPak= and =Solver=. (You only need the former
  for running Regression, but we may need the latter as well)
**** On Windows
1. Click =File= tab -> Click =Options= -> =Add-Ins= category.
2. Near the bottom of the =Excel Options= dialog box, make sure that =Excel
   Add-ins= is selected in the =Manage= box, and then click =Go...=.
3. In the =Add-Ins= dialog box, select the check boxes for =Analysis ToolPak=
   and =Solver Add-in=, and then click =OK=.
4. If Excel displays a message that states it can't run this add-in and
   prompts you to install it, click =Yes= to install the add-ins.
5. On the =Data= tab, note that an =Analyze= group has been added. This group
   contains command buttons for =Data Analysis= and for =Solver=.
**** On Mac
1. Go to the =Tools= menu, select =Add-ins=
2. Check =Analysis ToolPak= and =Solver Add-in= and then click =OK=
*** Running Regression Analysis in Excel
- Click =Data= -> =Data Analysis= -> Select =Regression= -> =OK=

- =Input Y Range=: Specify the range of cells that contain values for the
  dependent variable (\( y \)), _including the variable label_ (the first row)

- =Input X Range=: Specify the range of cells that contain values for the
  independent (predictor) variable (\( x \)), _including the variable label_
  (the first row)

  - For multiple regression, all \( x \) variables must be adjacent to each other. (no gaps)

  - Tip: You can use =Shift + Down Arrow= and =Ctrl + Shift + Down Arrow= to
    select a range of data conveniently

- Make sure =Labels= checkbox is checked
- Click =OK= (it will put the results on a new sheet)
