  I think I can talk about this separately from the simple random sampling.

- Suppose we can /repeatedly/ draw random samples of size \( n \) from the population 
- Then calculate the mean for /each/ sample:

  - e.g., \( \bar{x}_1 \): mean of the first sample, \( \bar{x}_2 \): mean of
    the second sample, ...

- Computation of variance of these _means_:
  
    #+REVEAL_HTML: <span style=font-size:22pt>
    \( s^2_{\bar{x}} = \dfrac{s^2}{n} \begin{cases} 
       \Uparrow &  \text{increases with increasing sample variance} (s^2) \\
       \Downarrow & \text{decreases with increasing sample size} (n)
       \end{cases} \)
    #+REVEAL_HTML: </span>

*** How reliable is the sample mean as the sample size increases?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none appear)
- The histogram of _sample means_ will eventually look like a normal
  distribution when \( n \) becomes larger and larger. (Central-Limit Theorem)
- The histogram will also be "thinner" as \( n \) goes larger.

  is, we have 1,000 independent samples each with \( n \) observations)

  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  Here, use Jaeeun's explanation. Draw circles as samples. Calculate the
  mean. They are more likely to get into the center of histograms.

*** Sample Mean and Standard Error
#+LATEX: \begin{multicols}{2}
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none appear)
- Sample mean :: \( \overline{x} \)
     
  #+REVEAL_HTML: <span class="fragment appear">
  Accuracy of sample mean depends on:
  #+REVEAL_HTML: </span>
  
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Sample variance :: \( s_x^2 \)
  - Sample size :: \( n \)
       
#+REVEAL: split

- Standard Error :: \( SE_{\overline{x}} = \sqrt{\dfrac{s^2_x}{n}} \)

#+LATEX: \end{multicols}

*** Standard Deviation VS. Standard Error
- Standard deviation (\( s_{x} \)) :: Describes the spread of values in the sample 
  
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - The sample standard deviation, \( s_x \) is a random quantity - it varies from
    sample to sample 
  - Becomes *more accurate representation of the population standard
    deviation* when the sample size increases

#+REVEAL: split

- Standard error of the mean (\( SE_{\bar{x}} \)) :: the standard deviation of
     the sample mean \( \bar{x} \)

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Describes \( \bar{x} \)'s accuracy as an estimate of the population mean,
    \( \mu \)
  - When the sample size increases, the estimator is based on more information
    and becomes more accurate, so *its standard error decreases*
*** Margin of error: Confidence interval of the mean
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none appear)
- What is a 95% confidence interval?
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none appear)
  - If we would draw samples of the same size _over and over again_, then in 95%
    of the times this interval covers the mean.
  - So it is a measure of reliability
  - \( [ \bar{x} \) {{{FRAG(\(- 1.96 SE_{\bar{x}} \))}}}, \(\quad \bar{x} \)
    {{{FRAG(\( + 1.96 SE_{\bar{x}} \))}}} \( ] \)

- It does _not_ mean that "there is a 95% chance that the population mean is
  in this specific confidence interval" @@latex:(See textbook page 277)@@
