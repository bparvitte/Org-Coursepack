# Contributing to Org-Coursepack

Org-Coursepack is an open source project and we appreciate community
contributions. Contributions should be made in the form of GitHub
pull requests.


## How Org-Coursepack is written

Org-Coursepack consists of multiple Org files written in
[org-mode](<https://orgmode.org/>), a major mode in Emacs. Hence, when you're
submitting changes to content, you'll be submitting changes to Org files.

In general we use [Git-flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) workflow, so we use `master` for releases. Hence,
[pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) should be made against the `develop` branch.


## Small Contributions

Since org-mode uses a markup syntax similar to markdown and reStructuredText,
small changes such as fixing typos and changing wording can be easily made
directly on GitHub using its online editor, by clicking on `Edit this file`
link while viewing an individual file. You can create a pull request from the
page once editing is done.


## Large Contributions

If you are interested in making substantial changes on Org-Coursepack,
please first open an issue so the issue can discussed before the changes are
made.


## All set!
