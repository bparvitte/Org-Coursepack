# Contributing to the Org-Coursepack

Org-Coursepack is an open source project, and we appreciate community
contributions. Contributions should be made in the form of GitHub
pull requests.

In general, we follow [Git-flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) 
as our workflow; hence, the `master` branch is used for releases, 
and [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) 
should be based on the `develop` branch.

## Small Contributions

Org-Coursepack consists of multiple Org files written in
[Org-mode](<https://orgmode.org/>), a major mode in Emacs. Since Org-mode uses 
a markup syntax similar to Markdown and reStructuredText,
small changes (e.g., fixing typos and wording) can be made
directly on GitHub using its online editor by clicking the `Edit this file`
link while viewing an individual file. You can create a pull request from the
page once you finish editing.


## Large Contributions
